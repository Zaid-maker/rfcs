# Adding API Endpoints to status page

API endpoints should be added to the status page for others to have a more easy way to track information such as uptime and planned maintenance.

## Motivation

Upptime currently provides JSON files in the GitHub repository that can be used to display a monitor's uptime using shields.io for rendering the data.  
While this may serve for a majority of the people does it lack features and may also suffer from possible rate limits as the githubusercontent.com domain is - to my knowledge - rate limited.

Adding an api endpoint to the status page could bypass this limitation while also providing a more extensible way for people to integrate the status page into their work (i.e. Discord Bot commands or alike).

## Structure

### Paths

The following Rest API paths are suggested:

```http
GET /api/monitor
GET /api/monitor/<monitor>
GET /api/incident
GET /api/incident/<id>
```

#### `/api/monitor`

Returns information of all currently tracked monitors including past incidents and planned maintenance.

**Query Parameters**  
- `range=<range>` (Optional): Sets the range of which to show data for. Acceptable values are `24h`, `7d`, `30d`, `1y` and `all`. Defaults to `7d` on no/invalid value.

### Response Headers

The following Response Headers should be included in successful, but also failed requests, if a Rate limiting is possible:

| Name               | Value                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Remaining-requests | Number of requests the User can make until the next reset |
| Reset-at           | UNIX timestamp of when the rate limit will be reset       |

For a `429` response should these additional headers be included:

| Name              | Value                                                             |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Wait-before-retry | Time in seconds before the User should do another request         |
| Wait-until        | UNIX timestamp of when the User can perform another request again |

### Failed and invalid Requests

#### Response Body

The response body is a `application/json` one which contains the status code and error message (Reason) as follows:

```json
{
  "code": 429,
  "message": "You've made too many requests. Please wait another 10 seconds before performing any new requests."
}
```

#### Response Codes and messages

The following combination of status code and message should be considered for the following cases:

| Case                     | Code | Message                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Invalid Monitor slug     | 404  | The provided monitor does not exist.                                                        |
| Invalid Incident ID      | 404  | The provided incident ID does not exist.                                                    |

The following combination of status code and message should also be considered, if technically doable:

| Case                     | Code | Message                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Making too many requests | 429  | Too many requests have been made. Please wait {n} seconds before doing another request.[^1] |

[^1]: `{n}` would be the number of seconds until a new request could be made. Additionally should `X-` headers be added.

## Limitations and Difficulties

Adding this would require a lot of extra work for the upptime tools to work with. And given that some users may not want an API to be exposed could this also require a configuration option to enable/disable these things.

Understanding the status page right are paths such as `example.com/incident/1` handled on the fly with no actual page in the backend, which most likely could be applied to the API paths too.

The next open question is regarding whether there should be a rate-limiting of sorts in place (if doable using GitHub Pages itself) or not and other things such as caching values for faster and less resource-intensive responses.
